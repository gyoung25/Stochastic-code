# Stochastic-code
Some code used to simulate and analyze stochastic processes

stochLV.m is MATLAB code to simulate the stochastic Lotka-Volterra model using the Gillespie algorithm. This code was used in Young and Belmonte 2022.

stochWF.M is MATLAB code simulating the discrete-time Wright-FIsher process as a Moran process. This code was used in Murray and Young 2020.

RandomWalk.ipynb is Python code to simulate a 2D, discrete-time, biased random walk.
